# Deep Reinforcement Learning Problems & Implementation

# History

It is created as part of the learning process for team **_HABYTec_** on Reinforcement Learning in preparation for the OISP Presentation Contest, a contest hosted by Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT) for their students.

# Purpose

This repository is a storage for implementations of popular Reinforcement Learning problems and their solutions. You can find detailed explaination of these problems in their separate directory and train these models by following their separate guidelines on a `.md` files.

The separate directories also contain mathematic explaination of these problems, while also exploring core principles of the Reinforcement Learning field.

For example, in `n_armed_bandit`, you can find the popular methods for solving the **exploration vs exploitation** dilemma with methods such as $\epsilon$-greedy or $\text{UCB}$ confidence.

# Usage

Besides the `.md` file in each repository containing specific instructions for running that problem, in general, you can execute the `problem_name/main.py` file with the specific flags to run the RL agent on the problem with any constraints / requirements you want.

The visualization of the result will also be found in the `problem_name/result_visualization.ipynb` file of each problem which contains detailed examination of the output and training graph of each agent.
